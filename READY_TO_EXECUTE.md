## 🚀 **What's Next: PHASE 1 EXECUTION**

### **The Plan**
```
1. CODE with Haiku (cheap, efficient)
2. FOLLOW implementation plan (detailed specs)
3. TEST on Ralphy repo (real-world validation)
4. ITERATE and improve
5. DEPLOY incrementally
```

### **Phase 1: Voice Agent Foundation** (2 weeks)

**What to build:**
1. Voice input capture (Web Audio API)
2. Intent parser (LLM-based)
3. Context manager (persistent memory)
4. Text-to-speech (voice response)

**Components to create:**
```typescript
// src/services/voice/
- VoiceCapture.ts
- AudioProcessor.ts
- VoiceDetector.ts
- IntentParser.ts
- ContextManager.ts
- TextToSpeech.ts
```

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test on Ralphy repo
/tmp/ralphy/

# Commands to validate:
"Audit Ralphy"              # Intent: code_review
"Check security"            # Intent: security_scan
"Generate tests for Ralphy" # Intent: add_tests
```

---

## 💻 **How to Execute**

### **Step 1: Generate Code** (using Haiku)
```
I will:
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Generate VoiceCapture.ts with Haiku
3. Generate IntentParser.ts
4. Generate other components
5. Create unit tests
6. All with detailed specs
```

### **Step 2: Test on Ralphy**
```
For each component:
1. Implement
2. Write tests
3. Run on Ralphy codebase
4. Validate results
5. Fix bugs
6. Integrate
```

### **Step 3: Deploy**
```
Push to GitHub → Deploy to Vercel → Live!
```

## 📊 **Cost Analysis**

### **Haiku API Cost**
```
Phase 1 (Voice Agent):    ~57k tokens = $0.27
Phase 2 (Slash Commands): ~38k tokens = $0.19
Phase 3 (Multi-Agent):    ~65k tokens = $0.31
Phase 4 (Decisions):      ~46k tokens = $0.23
Phase 5 (Learning):       ~40k tokens = $0.19
Phase 6 (Monitoring):     ~27k tokens = $0.13
Phase 7 (Testing):        ~60k tokens = $0.29

TOTAL:                    ~333k tokens = $1.61 💰

(Less than a coffee!)
